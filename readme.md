# gulp-rezzy
The incredibly fast image resizer utility for gulp.

## What
`gulp-rezzy` enables you to easily resize your images and then pipe each and every newly created version version of it into your stream. This allows you, for example, to only have one big background image asset in your source directory and then just generate several smaller versions of it for all your responsiveness needs. No more Photoshop  for you my friend!

## How
```bash
yarn add gulp-rezzy
```

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const rezzy = require('gulp-rezzy');

gulp.task('images:resize', () => {
    gulp.src('src/img/**/*')
        .pipe(rezzy([{
            width: 400,
            suffix: '-sm'
        }, {
            width: 800,
            suffix: '-md'
        }, {
            width: 1200,
            suffix: '-lg'
        }]))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/img'))
});
```

You can configure `gulp-rezzy` by passing in an array of objects containing your configs.

```js
const config = {
    width: 400, // width in px
    height: undefined, // height in px
    suffix: '.small' // string to append before the file extension
};
```

If there's a `width` present, `height` is optional, and vice-versa. One of them has to exist, else no transformation will be done. If both are present, the image might get skewed. If only one is, the other gets generated automatically to preserve the aspect ratio. This is the preferred way.
